# Basic DID Auth Workflow for WEB Applications

## Parties

- S: WEB Server
- A: ABT Wallet
- C: Web Client
- T: login token {token, did, status}

## Workflow

1. A web application that plan to use DID auth is hosted on `S`, web server
2. `C` loads a webpage from `S`, `C` found that user is not logged in
3. `C` ask `S` for a login token and login uri, the uri is used to display qrcode for `A` to scan
  - When `S` generates the login token, the login token is persisted in data store
  - The uri for `A` should contain the login token, so when `A` sends requests to `S`, `S` knows how to merge the session after authentication
  - `T = { token, status = created }`
4. `A` scan the qrcode displayed on `C`
5. `A` send `GET` request to `S`, to get application meta info, and requested claims
  - `S` should mark the qrcode status as `scanned` when receive this request
  - `A` should add `did` on the request url, so `S` knows how to merge the session
  - `T = { token, did, status = scanned }`
6. `A` collects user authenticated info and sign the payload, then send `POST` request to `S`
  - `S` should verify the jwt signature before any further processing
  - `S` should create/update the user when processing this request
  - `S` should only update login status when `token` and `did` match the stored ones
  - `T = { token, did, status = succeed | failed }`
7. When `C` got the token in step 3, it should check login status every second to get the login status
  - Login status should be notified on the web page when changed
  - Refresh the page when login status is `succeed`

> The above workflow not only works for login process, but also works for payment/signature/agreement process

## Token Storage Spec

> Since tokens are used everywhere make achieve better QR code experience, we should allow users to customize how to generate/store/update token records.

Basic APIs that a token storage should support:

- `async init()`, optional, open a database connection, creating a embed database on file system
- `async create(token, status = created)`, create a new token record, persist in data store
- `async exist?(token, did)`, check for token existense
- `async read(token)`, read a token from database,
- `async update(token, updates)`, update token record
- `async delete(token)`, remove a token record
- `async gc()`, optional, run garbage collection on the token storage

Plan to support:

- token-storage-mongo
- token-storage-psql
- token-storage-nedb
- token-storage-memory

## Issues

- Application need to verify DID used for login and payment
- Application should ask user to select payment DID
